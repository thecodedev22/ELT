# August 28: Researched and schematiced

So, im honestly like 70 percent sure this will work but, i have made a schematic diagram!!!

Moreover, i also researched what parts i would need. they include:
1x  light-bar
 1x XIAO-RP2040
1x 220Ω resistors 
1x small-button
1x 220Ω pull-up resistor 
Jumper wires/connections
Ground connections
1x buzzer
